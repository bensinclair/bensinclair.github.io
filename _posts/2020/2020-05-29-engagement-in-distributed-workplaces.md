Something on my mind at the moment is the importance of engagement, especially in a distributed workplace. The people who are going to do really well at distributed work are those who engage.

## What do I mean when I say “engage”?

- Participate in your team and company wide meetings.
- Communicate to your internal team effectively.
- Communicate outside your team effectively (especially if other teams depend on you).
- Create visibility on your work so others can benefit from that knowledge.
- Ask questions.
- Offer help to others.
- Show an interest in others.

This all boils down to one thing:

**COMMUNICATION**

For those who are more introverted, don’t take this as you have to be someone you’re not. I’m not expecting you to be loud and outgoing, but I expect you to not sit back while everyone else engages. 

We all lead in some capacity where we work, whether you think so or not. You all have a voice and something to add. 

If you have a leadership title, however, it’s even more important that you engage. If you don't step up and engage, someone else will. It's as simple as that.

What does engagement show? You’re with us! You’re onboard!

If you're not engaging, that's when people start to question what you're doing, wondering whether you're focusing on the right things, chasing you for answers, asking themselves if you truly are a good culuture fit. Don't let it be this way. Engage.

Let’s all become better at engagement in 2020. Don't get left behind.
